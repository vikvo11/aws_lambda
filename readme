Let’s have AWS S3 Bucket, that requires IAM authentication on all requests.
We would like to implement a system that records size of uploaded files to the S3 bucket per AWS principal used during upload. The sizes should be added to AWS CloudWatch metrics.

Example:

IAM user Peter uploads file with size 10Kb … then metric /CodingTest/Peter will contain point with value 10Kb.
IAM user Viktor uploads file with size 20Kb … then metric /CodingTest/Viktor will contain point with value 20Kb.

Hey
Please see steps below:

1) Create IAM Users
2) Create S3 bucket

3) Give permission to work with S3 bucket in IAM policy and/or in S3 bucket policy
for example
-Read only for all S3 in IAM:
>>"s3:Get*","s3:List*"
-Modify rights for certain users in s3 bucket policy:
>>"s3:DeleteObject","s3:PutObject"

-But we can also use only IAM or only s3 bucket policy

4) Create Lambda function + grant permision of Lambda role for "iam:GetAccountAuthorizationDetails" + "cloudwatch:PutMetricData"
5) Add Lambda trigпer> Event type: s3:ObjectCreated:*
